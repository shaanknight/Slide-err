# Slide-err
These days, the demand for online lectures is increasing. For better visual experience,
along with the video of the lecture, soft copy of the slides is also being embedded into the
video. But most of the universities are manually matching slides from the video to the soft
copy which is a laborious task. So the problem statement is to automate this slide matching
process.

So to be more precise, given a set of noisy slide images extracted from the video and
a set of slides from the original ppt, we build a mapping for each of the sampled
noisy slides with the corresponding original slide.

The details of the 2 techniques used are mentioned in the pdf Report.pdf . It is a simple yet 
effective way to accomplish the task . Accuracy : 94.9% against the dataset found here :
